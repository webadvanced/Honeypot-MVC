#What is a honeypot?#

*From wikipedia* in computer terminology, a honeypot is a trap set to detect, deflect, or in some manner counteract attempts at unauthorized use of information systems. Generally it consists of a computer, data, or a network site that appears to be part of a network, but is actually isolated and monitored, and which seems to contain information or a resource of value to attackers.

###What is adds to your solution###
 
- SimpleHoneypot.dll
- WebActivator.dll
- App_Start directory
- App_Start/SimpleHoneypot.cs
 
###Default configuration of SimpleHoneypot.cs### 

	public static void Start() {
				RegisterHoneypotInputNames(Honeypot.InputNames);
			}
			
			public static void RegisterHoneypotInputNames(HoneypotInputNameCollection collection) {
				//Honeypot will use 2 words at random to create the input name {0}-{1}
				collection.Add(new[]
							   {
								   "User",
								   "Name",
								   "Age",
								   "Question",
								   "List",
								   "Why",
								   "Type",
								   "Phone",
								   "Fax",
								   "Custom",
								   "Relationship",
								   "Friend",
								   "Pet",
								   "Reason"
							   });
			}
			
###Other configuration options###

By Default, Simple Honeypot will render an input with a CSS class name called 'input-imp-long'. You can change this CSS by calling `Honeypot.SetCssClassName("newCssName")` in the Start function of the SimpleHoneypot.cs class.

###The controller###

You will need to annotate the Action of your controller with the `[Honeypot]` Filter Attribute.

	[Honeypot, HttpPost]
	public ActionResult Comment(BlogComment comment) {
		/* Some Processing */
		return RedirectToAction("Index");
	}


###The View###

Next, you will need to add a call to the HoneypotInput HtmlHelper in your form.

	@using SimpleHoneypot.HtmlHelpers
	@model BlogComment

	@using(Html.BeginForm("Comment", "Blog")) {
		@Html.EditorForModel()
		@Html.HoneypotInput()
		<p>
			<input type="submit" value="Comment" />
		</p>
	}
	
###Adding a class to your style sheet###

By default Simple Honeypot will use 'input-imp-long' for the input generated. However, if you used the `Honeypot.SetCssClassName("newCssName")` you will need to use the custom css name.

	.input-imp-long { display: none; }
**or**

	.newCssName { display: none; }
